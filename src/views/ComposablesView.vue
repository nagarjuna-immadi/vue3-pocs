          <b>Composability: </b>Composability is a system design principle that deals with the
          inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can
          be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements.
        </li>
        <li><b>Composable: </b>capable of being composed</li>
        <li>
          In the context of Vue applications, a "composable" is a function that leverages Vue
          Composition API to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.
        </li>
        <li>There are many libraries out there for reusing stateless logic - for example lodash</li>
        <li>stateful logic involves managing state that changes over time</li>
        <li>one composable can be used in another composable</li>
        <li>As per my understanding, composables are nothing but services</li>
