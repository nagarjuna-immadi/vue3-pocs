- transition and transition group components are for implimenting animation operations
- <Teleport> is a built-in component that allows us to "teleport" a part of a component's template into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of that component.
- <Suspense> is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.
    - It is at experimental phase. Not yet stable.
